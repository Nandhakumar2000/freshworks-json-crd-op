  eg: node index.js /Users/nandhakumar/Desktop
  
## Given Solution

- Console Application to do CRD operation, Satisfying the functional and Non-Functional requirements.

- I chose Node.js for development because I am currently learning it.

- App will store data in JSON file. I chose the JSON as storing format because it is easy to access Key-Value Data.  
  
## Supported Operations

- Create
- Read
- Delete

## Upcoming Features

- Every key supports setting a Time-To-Live property when it is created. This property is optional. If provided, it will be evaluated as an integer defining the number of seconds the key must be retained in the data store. Once the Time-To-Live for a key has expired, the key will no longer be available for or Delete operations
- The client will bear as little memory costs as possible to use this data store while deriving maximum performance with respect to response times for accessing the data store.
